## The Knapsack Problem
***

Imagine you're a traveler with a knapsack/backpack with a specific weight capacity. You have a collection of items, each with its weight and value. The objective is to select a combination of items that maximizes the total value without exceeding the weight capacity of the knapsack.

**Parameters**:
- $W$: Positive integer representing the weight capacity of the knapsack.
- $n$: Total number of available items, indexed from 1 to $n$.
- $w_i$: Weight of item $i$.
- $v_i$: Value of item $i$.

**Objective**: Find a maximum-value subset of items that can be carried in the knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity.

### A Dynamic Programming Solution

Dynamic Programming (DP) offers an efficient way to solve the Knapsack Problem by breaking it down into smaller overlapping sub-problems and building upon their solutions. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Defining the Subproblem**:
   For any integers $i$ (0 ≤ i ≤ W) and $j$ (0 ≤ j ≤ n), let's define $a_{i,j}$ as the value of the maximum-value subset of items from 1 through $j$ with a total weight not exceeding $i$.

2. **Base Case**:
   - When $i = 0$ or $j = 0$, $a_{i,j} = 0$. This means either the knapsack has no capacity, or there are no items to choose from.

3. **Recursive Relation**:
   - If the weight of the current item $w_j$ exceeds $i$, then the item cannot be included in the solution. Hence, the value remains unchanged: $a_{i,j} = a_{i,j−1}$.
   - If the weight of the current item is less than or equal to $i$, we have a choice: either to include the item or exclude it. We choose the option that gives the maximum value:
     $$a_{i,j} = \max(a_{i,j−1}, v_j + a_{i−w_j,j−1})$$

4. **Computing the Solution**:
   - Fill the DP table using the recursive relation. This requires $O(nW)$ operations, as each cell needs to be computed once.
   - Once the table is filled, you can find the optimal solution by tracing backwards. This requires $O(n + W)$ operations.


### Understanding the O(nW) Time Complexity

1. **Two Parameters**: The time complexity has two parameters: $n$ (number of items) and $W$ (knapsack weight capacity).

2. **Operational Bound**: For certain positive constants ($c$, $n_0$, and $W_0$), the total number of operations is bounded by $cnW$ for all $n \gt n_0$ and $W \gt W_0$.

3. **$W$'s Magnitude**: It's noteworthy that $W$ can be significantly large, sometimes even exponential in terms of $n$ (e.g., $W = 2^n$). Therefore, while the bound is polynomial in $n + W$, it isn't polynomial in $n$ alone.

4. **Polynomial Time Clarification**: The $O(nW)$ bound doesn't imply polynomial time in the traditional sense. Usually, when we talk about polynomial time, we mean the algorithm's running time is polynomial in the size of the input. Here, however, the running time can become large if $W$ is big, even if $n$ is small.

5. **Multi-parameter Bounds**: These are quite common in computer science. They signify that the performance depends on more than one aspect of the input.




## Polynomial-Time Algorithms
***

When discussing the efficiency of algorithms, one frequently encountered term is "polynomial time." Let's break down what this means and delve deeper into the associated concepts:


### Understanding Polynomial Time
1. **Definition**: An algorithm is said to run in polynomial time if its running time can be upper bounded by a polynomial function based on the length of its input. For example, O(n^2) or O(n^3) are polynomial time complexities.
  
2. **Input Length**: The input's length typically refers to its size in bits. This is particularly crucial when considering problems where the input is a number.

3. **Efficient Encoding**: Efficiently encoding inputs is vital. Consider an integer, *k*. Using a binary representation (base-2), *k* can be expressed using $\Theta(\log k)$ bits. However, using unary representation (a series of 1s), it would take $\Theta(k)$ bits. Binary is more efficient for large values of $k$.

#### Deep Dive into the $O(nW)$ Bound

1. **Knapsack Input Length**: In the context of the knapsack problem, the total input length can be thought of as the combined lengths of the binary representations of all numbers in the input.

2. **Problematic $O(nW)$ Bound**:
   - If each number in the knapsack input has a binary representation of length $\Theta(n)$, the entire input's length is $\Theta(n^2)$.
   - Given $W = 2^{\Theta(n)}$, the $O(nW)$ running time isn't polynomial concerning the input length.

3. **A Polynomial Variant**: If the weights in the knapsack problem are limited such that their maximum value is polynomial in *n* (i.e., represented with $O(\log n)$ bits), then our algorithm does indeed run in polynomial time.


### Pseudopolynomial Time

**Definition**: An algorithm runs in pseudopolynomial time if its running time is polynomial concerning the input length when integers in the input are represented in unary.

**Knapsack's Pseudopolynomial Nature**:
- With unary representation, a knapsack problem instance's length becomes $\Omega(n + W)$.
- Given this, the $O(nW)$ bound is quadratic in the input size, making the algorithm pseudopolynomial.


### NP-completeness Remarks

1. **Knapsack as NP-Complete**: The knapsack problem will later be classified as an NP-complete problem in your course. In simple terms, this implies that the problem is as "hard" as the hardest problems in the class NP.
  
2. **Implication**: There's a significant statement in computational theory that no polynomial-time algorithm exists for NP-complete problems unless P equals NP. The question of whether P equals NP is one of the biggest unsolved problems in computer science. Most experts believe they are not equal, implying that no polynomial-time solution exists for NP-complete problems.

In sum, understanding the intricacies of time complexities and classifications like polynomial-time or pseudopolynomial-time is crucial. They not only shed light on an algorithm's efficiency but also provide insights into the inherent difficulty of the problems the algorithms address.





## Alternate Knapsack DP Solution

The initial dynamic programming solution for the knapsack problem focused on maximizing the value for a given weight. This alternative approach flips the objective: for a given value, it tries to minimize the weight.

<h4>Conceptual Foundation</h4>

- $V$: Represents the sum of the values of all items, i.e., $V = \sum_{j=1}^{n} v_j$.
  
- $b_{i,j}$: For any integers $i$ (0 ≤ i ≤ V) and $i$ (0 ≤ j ≤ n), $b_{i,j}$ denotes the minimum weight of items 1 through $j$ that can achieve a value of at least $i$. If no such subset of items exists, then $b_{i,j}=\infty$.

<h4>Recursive Formulation</h4>

1. **Base Cases**:
   - If $i = 0$, then $b_{i,j} = 0$. (No value means no weight)
   - If $i \gt 0$ and $j = 0$, then $b-{i,j}=\infty$. (There are no items to pick from)

2. **Recursive Relations**:
   - If $i > 0$, $j > 0$, and $i < v_j$, then $b_{i,j} = \min(b_{i,j−1}, w_j)$. 
     (Either don’t include the current item or just include the current item)
   - Otherwise, $b_{i,j} = min(b_{i,j−1}, w_j + b_{i−v_j,j−1})$. 
     (Either don’t include the current item or include the current item and also consider the weight needed for the remaining value)

3. **Computing the Solution**:
   - Fill up the dynamic programming table using the recursive relations. This process takes $O(nV)$ operations.
   - Once the table is populated, an optimal solution can be found by tracing back through the table, which requires $O(n + V)$ operations.

### Analysis of the O(nV) Time Complexity

1. **Pseudopolynomial Nature**: The $O(nV)$ running time provides another pseudopolynomial time algorithm for the knapsack problem.

2. **Polynomial Variant**: If we limit the knapsack problem such that item values are restricted to be polynomial in *n* (i.e., represented with $O(\log n)$ bits), then this alternate dynamic programming solution offers a polynomial-time algorithm.


## The Complexity of the Knapsack Problem: Recap
***
1. **Polynomial Solution with Weight Restriction**: If each item's weight can be represented using $O(\log n)$ bits, the knapsack problem can be efficiently solved in polynomial time.
  
2. **Polynomial Solution with Value Restriction**: Similarly, if each item's value can be represented using $O(\log n)$ bits, a polynomial-time solution exists.

3. **Pseudopolynomial Nature**: The general (unrestricted) knapsack problem can be solved in pseudopolynomial time. However, a truly polynomial-time solution does not exist (based on our current understanding of computational theory) unless P equals NP.

Overall, the knapsack problem beautifully illustrates the nuances of algorithmic complexity and showcases the power and versatility of dynamic programming in problem-solving.
