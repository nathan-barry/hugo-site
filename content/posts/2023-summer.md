### Reflection
My summer was pretty decent. I did essentially a year's worth of classes, read a ton of books, riced up my setup ten-fold, and wrote a lot of code. I learned a tremendous amount about number theory, algebraic structures, physics, Rust, etc., and got good at climbing, juggling, and whatever I decided to do (omit skateboarding).

At the start of the summer, I actually didn't know what I was going to do. I planned on doing research but was unsure whether it (or a PhD) would be something I'd actually enjoy. I discovered that I could double major in Math and also do the integrated CS master's program if I just got a few summer classes out of the way, so that is what I did.

Great decision. I'm really happy with how the summer turned out. As always, much smarter than before. May that trend continue.



### Reflection from 2024
My original reflection was pretty spot on. Ended up actually doing research, double majoring in math, and doing the integrated CS masters program. Also initially met what would turn out to be my future girl friend as we were both councilors at the CS Summer Academy. It was a pretty great year following, and knocking out all of the classes that I did let me make room for the classes I actually wanted to take.
