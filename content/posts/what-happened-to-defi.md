## DRAFT OUTLINE
***
### Why did people believe in it?
-  The narrative

- The sovereign individual
- Libertarianism
- Upturning the old financial system to create something open
    - Permissionless, doesn’t matter who you are
        - This is a good narrative, letting no rich people have special access to things, but it allows means letting bad actors have access to things to. That is bad if they ruin things for others

The same things that people thought that could make defi useful made it bad

- Permissionless
- Opensource
- Composability

### These things fed into the narrative below. 

- Open source was thought to make things more robust.
    - Debian has had 3000 exploits. Exploits in crypto leads to instant death. What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, but in defi everything kills you. No such thing as a paper cut.
- Composability
    - Dependency issues but magnified by a thousand. If anything you depend on has a bug, you can get hacked
- Permissionless
    - Allows anyone to interact with the smart contract equally. This lack of admin privilegages causes things to be more brittle.

The system was too brittle to do what it needed to do

Narratives and good times pushed smart people to ignore the obvious

- Ohm was literally a ponzi scheme, some of the smartest people I knew thought it was bullet proof
- Make narratives that we are likely to believe instead of think critically

### Facts about building in defi
- Any system that relies on humans being perfect is doomed to fail. Smart contracts required systems to be built with no bugs
- Building large applications with no bugs is nearly an impossible task, and the larger the code base the exponentially harder it gets

### The split between defi and centralized exchanges

- Centralized exchanges are unregulated financial institutions.
    - The worst thing we can possibly create
    - “Not your keys, not your crypto”
        - Outsourcing trust to an unregulated entity
- Decentralized defi
    - Outsourcing trust to whoever built the product
    - “Move fast and break things” does not apply, if you break something in defi everyone dies
        - Startups attract and are made by these types of people. Also plenty of new and inexperienced people. Not the best to be making perfect, intricate, financial instruments.
    - Cap on complexity - anything more complex than an exchange gets exploited.

## Why did people first get into Defi?
***

Defi exploded between 2021-2023 and had a spectacular collapse. After billions of dollars lost from hacks, scams, ponzi schemes, and market manipulation, all ranging between the discrete and the obvious, we are left wondering, "What happened to Defi?". To answer that, we must learn why people saw potential in it in the first place.

My first semester at UT Austin started near the end of COVID. Many of my classes were online and most events were canceled. Eager to make friends with similar interests (and to actually meet people in real life), I checked out all of the CS related clubs UT had to offer.

None of the clubs I went to grabbed my interest. Then I went to a Texas Blockchain meeting (UT Austin's Blockchain club) and was absolutely struck by it. Every week, they brought a phenomenal speaker. All were people who were in early and who made millions or built protocols with hundreds of millions in TVL (a example being Joseph Delong, founder of SushiSwap which had 8 billion dollars TVL at its peak).

Not only were these people successful, but they had a strong conviction that what they were doing was helping the world. They were the new trail blazers creating a whole new financial system where everyone had equal access. They were building on decentralized systems that were outside of the realms of individual nations, far from the currency manipulations of centralized governments.

It was new and exciting. It doesn't hurt that billions of dollars of VC and retail investment was flowing in, that everyone was making money, and that there were Super Bowl ads featuring Matt Dameon promoting it. I eventually became the Vice President of the club and met many VCs and builders in the space. I helped host hackathons, developer workshops, and eventually took a gap semester (and a summer) to work in the industry.

### Ideology & Narrative

- Soverign Individual, Liberitatian ideology
- Jerome Powell Inflation (irresponsible governemnts, venezuala)
- Ocupy wallstreet (people thinking that we've been getting screwed over by the "big guys")


## All Double Edged Swords: Potentials and Flaws
***

Innovations in blockchain technology and consensus algorithms created many new possibilities for what financial services could look like. Permissionless meant that everyone had equal access. It doesn't matter who you were or how much money you had, you had equal access to the same things as everyone else.

The fact that code had to be deployed on the blockchain made it all protocols open source by default. All of the logic was out in the open for anyone to see. This means that there was transparency with whatever you were interacting with. You could be fairly sure that there wasn't a backdoor or some malevolent code and that the protocol did what it advertised.

Composability between protocols meant that we can build new financial services by using others as primitives, allowing for novel financial products. All of these potentials were true, but as we'll see, with each promise came with a fundamental flaw which would lead to Defi being innately brittle, risky, and niche.

### Permissionless

### Open Source

### Composability


## Too Much Kool-Aid and Bad UX 
***

I remember having many conversations that went like this:

<span style="color: red; style:"><i>Person A:</i></span>
Wow we should put property on the blockchain. Has anyone ever thought of that? {{%sidenote%}}Approximately 20 million people have thought about that (Source: Me). About 20 seconds of thought is required to realize why this is a terrible idea.{{%/sidenote%}}

<span style="color: pink; style:"><i>Me:</i></span>
Why would anyone want that?

<span style="color: red; style:"><i>Person A:</i></span>
Why would we not want it? Anything on a blockchain is better. We wouldn't have to go through so much trouble when selling a house. We wouldn't need to deal with government bureaucratic rubbish. 

<span style="color: pink; style:"><i>Me:</i></span>
So what happens when Grandma gives her seed phrase or keys to someone and they take her house.

<span style="color: red; style:"><i>Person A:</i></span>
Huh. I didn't think about that.

To a certain extent, this was everyone.
