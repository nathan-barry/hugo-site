"I believe that a man should strive for only one thing in life, and that is to have a touch of greatness"
<br>— Félix Martí-Ibáñez

“The march of Providence is so slow and our desires so impatient; the work of progress so immense and our means of aiding it so feeble; the life of humanity is so long, that of the individual so brief, that we often see only the ebb of the advancing wave and are thus discouraged. It is history that teaches us to hope.”
<br>― Robert E. Lee
