<span class="sidenote"><b>Image Backstory:</b> There were once raccoons living in my attic. I caught them and released them away from my house. I took a photo with each one caught (this is raccoon #2).</span>

I am a Computer Science and Mathematics major at UT Austin. I was born in Saint Joseph, Missouri. I started programming in 2017 my freshman year of high school, with Python and JavaScript, serving PyTorch models with Flask and React. Currently, I spend most of my time on schoolwork, side projects, and (hopefully) writing.

In my free time, I enjoy climbing, biking, and playing ultimate frisbee with the CS Ultimate team (now bowling with the CS squad). I also enjoy [reading books a lot](/posts/favorite-books/). Currently, I am growing 12 pepper plants. I'm growing 4 different strains of Habanero Pepper and one variant of Ghost Pepper.

## Life Philosophy
***
My life philosophy started crystalizing when I was 15 and has remained more or less constant ever since. It was heavily inspired by Aldous Huxley, Nietzsche, Robert Greene, Carl Jung, William Rees-Mogg and James Dale Davidson, Ayn Rand, Dostoevsky, and a few other names.

<!-- One of the main things that makes humans special is that we are cognisant that time passes and the concept of a future. We acknowledge that we can sacrifice today to make a better tomorrow, not just for you but for all those after. -->

<!-- We consist of a community of different versions of ourselves propagated across time. You aren't just who you are now, but also you a day from now, a year, a decade, etc. What you choose to do today will directly affect all of those future versions of you. One should act in accordance with whatever will maximize the expected value of fulfillment across all of those versions, not just the version of you today. -->

I recall once hearing the quote, *"Bees make honey. Beavers build dams. Humans create progress".* **Progress seems to be the general motif of humanity**. Being able to create new things that are recognized to have value is a fundamental human desire and is what we derive fulfillment from.

The only consistent things that regularly lead to the creation of value and novelty are competence and hard work. Competence is having the proper knowledge and ability to solve problems. Hard work is having the endurance to actually solve them.

The word **MORE** describes humanity at all levels, from individuals to corporations, states, societies, and humanity as a whole. On an individual level, one desires to become more than who they are. Becoming better as time passes is what characterizes life and is a necessary pursuit. One should adopt as much responsibility as one can and always be pushing beyond what they think they are capable are. We must do our part in driving humanity forward. We must do our part to make our lives better, and the lives of all generations going forward.

> "His answer to every problem, every setback, was 'I will work harder!' – which he had adopted as his personal motto."--- George Orwell, Animal Farm

Many of my core views and values came from Huxley and Nietzsche. A good short read by Aldous Huxley is [*Pleasures*](/posts/pleasures).



## Favorite Poems
---
Sometimes in life you forget exactly how something goes. Below are a few of my favorite poems and speeches that I recite to myself at times, located here for easy access in case I forget how a few bits went.

### Roosevelt's Man in The Arena
It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming;
but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

### Kipling's If
<span style="white-space: pre-line;">If you can keep your head when all about you
&emsp;&emsp;Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
&emsp;&emsp;But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
&emsp;&emsp;Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
&emsp;&emsp;And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:
</span>

<span style="white-space: pre-line">
If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
&emsp;&emsp;If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
&emsp;&emsp;And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
&emsp;&emsp;Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
&emsp;&emsp;And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:
</span>

<span style="white-space: pre-line">
If you can make one heap of all your winnings
&emsp;&emsp;And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
&emsp;&emsp;And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
&emsp;&emsp;To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
&emsp;&emsp;Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’
</span>

<span style="white-space: pre-line">
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
&emsp;&emsp;Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
&emsp;&emsp;If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
&emsp;&emsp;With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,
&emsp;&emsp;And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
</span>

### Dylan Thomas' Do not go gentle into that good night
<span style="white-space: pre-line"> Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
</span>

<span style="white-space: pre-line">
Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.
</span>

<span style="white-space: pre-line">
Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
</span>

<span style="white-space: pre-line">
Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.
</span>

<span style="white-space: pre-line">
Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
</span>

<span style="white-space: pre-line">
And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
</span>
