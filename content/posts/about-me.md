## Nathan Barry
***
I am a Computer Science and Mathematics major at UT Austin. I was born in Saint Joseph, Missouri. I started programming in 2017 my freshman year of high school, with Python and JavaScript, serving PyTorch models with Flask and React. Currently, I can mainly be found taking notes and dabbling in side projects with Rust.

In my free time, I enjoy climbing, biking, and playing ultimate frisbee with the CS Ultimate team. I also enjoy reading books a lot.

I am also a pepper farmer. I am currently growing 4 strains of Habanero Pepper and one variant of Ghost Pepper.

## Life Philosophy
***
My life philosophy started crystalizing when I was 15 and has remained more or less constant ever since. Below is a quick snippet of my thoughts.

One of the main things that makes humans special is that we are cognisant that time passes and the concept of a future. We acknowledge that we can sacrifice today to make a better tomorrow, not just for you but for all those after.

We consist of a community of different versions of ourselves propagated across time. You aren't just who you are now, but also you a day from now, a year, a decade, etc. What you choose to do today will directly affect all of those future versions of you. One should act in accordance with whatever will maximize the expected value of fulfillment across all of those versions, not just the version of you today.

I recall once hearing the quote, "Bees make honey. Beavers build dams. Humans create progress". Progress seems to be the general motif of humanity. I think that being able to create new things which are recognized to have value is a fundamental characteristic of humans and necessary to live a fulfilled life. The only thing that allows someone to create something new and of value is competence and hard work. The bar is always being pushed. It is at the edge of human knowledge that this value is captured.

I believe that hard work and competence are the only things that will lead to that outcome. Competence is the knowledge and ability to take action and get something done. The more a person can do, the more value they can provide and catch for and from society. Everyone should desire to be a competent individual in as many fields as possible and put their competence to good use.

It is the word "MORE" which drives humanity, from individuals to corporations to states, societies, and humanity as a whole. On an individual level, one must become more than who they are. Becoming better as time passes is what characterizes life, and it is this process that is innately twined with fulfillment.

Life should follow the format of the archetypal hero’s journey, a process of self-growth. One should adopt as much responsibility as one can and always be pushing beyond what they think they are capable are. As humanity drives itself forward, so must we. We must do our part to make our lives better, and the lives of all generations going forward. It is up to us to become who we could be.

## Why Raccoons???
***
It was my senior year of high school. My room had a loft bed with a desk under it which meant that I was only a few feet from the ceiling when I slept. One night, I saw eyes in the darkness staring at me. I shined a light and saw a raccoon staring back at me. There were Raccoons living in the ceiling above me and were causing a ruckus all night (at the expense of my sleep quality). 

After a week of getting no sleep, my dad bought a raccoon trap and set it up in the attic. Over the course of that winter we caught 4 raccoons. We drove to the edge of the town and let them loose in a forest, but not before I got some legendary pictures.
