<!-- ## Projects -->
<!-- *** -->
<!-- - **NN in rust** -->
<!-- - Symbolic Math lib post -->
<!-- - Game of life wasm -->
<!-- - Blockchain in Rust -->
<!-- - Turning machine from scratch -->
<!-- - Rust parser binary nor gate -->
<!--     - It’s like op codes but with one pattern that represents nor gate and then the output. Make rust program that does stuff with these binary xor gates -->


## Misc Post
***
- **What happened to Defi?**
- A personal site is an internet garden
- Great Man theory of history as a Stochastic Process
    - The magnitude of a vector is the "societal forces and pressures" but it is an individual or a batch that determines the direction of magnitude.

- No go preprocessor -> Why go doesn't use zero-cost generic abstractions, monomorphization (uses boxing instead)

- What is the quadratic formula? Why does it work?
- JPG vs PNG vs WebP
- Rubix cube variance in number of twists to solution
- Different kinds of threads (green, virtual, etc)
- Cum Kum and Go short story

- A postiori and a priori
- binary addition similar to parity
- What is a criminal?
    - Jullian assage, edward snowden
    - A criminal is whatever the state deems it
        - Not always aligned with public interest
- Verbs as functions
- Why does secant newtons method have the golden ratio as it’s power?
- Why isn't DNA in binary
- Declarative vs imperitive programming
<!-- - Pascals triangle binomial -->
<!--     - 4 by 3 grid start at left bottom, get to right top, can only move up and right. there is 7 choose 3 ways of traversing. -->
<!--     - Number of paths at each point ends up being pascal’s triangle. -->
<!--     - Binomial coefficient is coefficient choose power of x -->
<!--         - ex. (5C3) x^3 y^2 -->
<!--     - Pascals triangle, each term is sum of two above. Each term is also number of paths to that term, if you think of it like the grid problem. -->
