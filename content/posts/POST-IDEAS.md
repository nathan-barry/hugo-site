## Projects
***
- **NN in rust**
- Symbolic Math lib post
- Game of life wasm
- Blockchain in Rust
<!-- - Turning machine from scratch -->
<!-- - Rust parser binary nor gate -->
<!--     - It’s like op codes but with one pattern that represents nor gate and then the output. Make rust program that does stuff with these binary xor gates -->


## Misc Post
***
- **What happened to Defi?**
- HACKER NEWS BAIT
    - What is the quadratic formula?
    - JPG vs PNG vs WebP
    - Rubix cube variance in number of twists to solution
    - Different kinds of threads (green, virtual, etc)
- A postiori and a priori
- binary addition similar to parity
- What is a criminal?
    - Jullian assage, edward snowden
    - A criminal is whatever the state deems it
        - Not always aligned with public interest
- Verbs as functions

<!-- - Pascals triangle binomial -->
<!--     - 4 by 3 grid start at left bottom, get to right top, can only move up and right. there is 7 choose 3 ways of traversing. -->
<!--     - Number of paths at each point ends up being pascal’s triangle. -->
<!--     - Binomial coefficient is coefficient choose power of x -->
<!--         - ex. (5C3) x^3 y^2 -->
<!--     - Pascals triangle, each term is sum of two above. Each term is also number of paths to that term, if you think of it like the grid problem. -->
