I found myself staring at leaves while walking outside. Walking is a normal activity I find myself doing when I’m deep in thought, pondering about life. This time it was outside in the neighborhood I live in, north of the university I attend. I have walked the same path dozens of times before, but that does not make it noteworthy, as walking is something that I find myself doing often.

Usually, it is in a circle in whatever room I find myself to occupy. I always stare at the floor, stooped in my own thoughts, automatically and unconsciously moving one foot after another. I tend to walk in a counterclockwise circle, but I consciously switch to avoid any uneven wearing of the knees.

Something in my conscious likes stepping on interesting patterns. Generally, it is where the wooden boards of the floor I’m standing on meet, peppering my floor with an appealingly random cornucopia of segments that my feet follow. If the floor is tiled, I might move around like a knight in chess, moving only 2 tiles up and one to the side on each step. This time, I was stepping on the leaves of the winter ground, going in one large 12-block clockwise loop.

It came to me that I must look ridiculous to any outsider. To someone on the outside, it appears as if I’m stumbling forward like a drunkard with no rhyme or reason. To me, everything made sense. One leaf to the next, like a frog jumping from lilypad to lilypad. It dawned on me how within this kernel of thought held a very human archetype: the outside and the inside, the strange and the familiar, of chaos and order, to be known or misunderstood. How often there are barriers between people that makes each look incomprehensible to another. That’s something I could relate to, as we do with all human archetypes. With this train of thought over, my mind moved on as I stepped on the next leaf.
