## Events in Chronological Order
---

### Monday, April 8th, 2024
Roma added me on discord. I apologized for my e-girl profile picture and we talked about machine learning. We chatted generally for the next few days.

### Sunday, April 14th, 2024
First time hanging out. We played frisbee at the park I used to live by and talked for a few hours.

### Saturday, April 20th, 2024
Second time hanging out. I picked her up in front of the PMA at around 2 PM since San Jacinto Blvd was closed due to a football game. We baked cookie dough and walked around Ladybird Lake and talked late into the night.

### Tuesday, April 23th, 2024
Third time hanging out. I picked her up at 6 PM and we around Ladybird Lake again and visited the Austin Central Library. We looked at books and played Big chess, where I was slightly annoyed at how long she took per move.

### Wednesday, April 24th, 2024
Fourth time hanging out. We went to Mount Bonnell at 8:30 PM and climbed down to a hidden edge of the cliff and talked late into the night.

### Thursday, April 25th, 2024
Fifth time hanging out. We went for a run around Ladybird Lake at 9 PM. We ran two miles, but since I've already ran enough in my life, we decided to walk around and explore and find our way back. Roma doubted my sense of directions and I proved her wrong yet again.

### Saturday, April 27th, 2024
Sixth time hanging out. We were going to play spike ball at Clark field, until Roma remembered she had a CSB banquet to go to. She invites me and we get there at 6:30, where none of her friends talked to me (but did text about me interestingly enough).

### Sunday, April 28th, 2024
Seventh time hanging out. Rise and grind, we lift. Roma couldn't bench 45 pounds but that's fine, we all gotta start somewhere. I made her squat, deadlift, bench, and everything else under the sun.

### Monday, April 29th, 2024
Eighth time hanging out. Roma worked on her Comp Arch final project until midnight (when it was due). I picked her up at 11:57 PM and we went to Mount Bonnell. We sat in our spot again and talked late into the night. I gave her a piggy back ride on the journey back down because the gym session the other day physically broke her. I asked her if she wanted to date later that night. Since it was past midnight, we started dating on **April 30th, 2024**.
